# Data Storytelling: Analysing Survival on the Titanic 🚢

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **data storytelling and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using the famous **Titanic dataset**.  
The goal is to understand **which factors influenced passenger survival** during the Titanic disaster and present insights in a clear, story-driven manner.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset
- Analyze survival patterns based on:
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Passenger class
  - Fare
  - Embarkation port
- Visualize insights to support data-driven storytelling

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset: **Titanic Dataset**
- Source: Kaggle / Public dataset
- Target Variable: `Survived`
  - `0` → Did not survive  
  - `1` → Survived  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Univariate & bivariate analysis
- Survival comparison using visualizations
- Story-based interpretation of results

---

## 🔍 Key Insights (Highlights)
- Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men
- Passengers in **1st class** were more likely to survive
- Children had better survival chances
- Fare and passenger class showed a strong correlation with survival
